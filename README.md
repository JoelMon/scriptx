# ScriptX
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

ScriptX is a command line tool designed to extract scriptures out of the American Sign Language version of the [New World Translation](https://www.jw.org/ase/library/bible/nwt/books/), NWT, Bible published by the [Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania](https://www.JW.org). It is useful when you need specific scripture(s) in a standalone file. A quick example would be if you need to splice scriptures into another video. 

All the meta data stored within the original file is retained even after being extracted, so when extracting a range you will still have access to chapter markers within your extracted video.

## Features
- Extract single or a range of scriptures eg. `-v 5-10` extracts verses ranging from 5 to 10
- Maintains all metadata from the original file
- Doesn't transcode so blazing :fire: fast!

## Dependencies 
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is required and has to be installed.


## Installation
ScriptX hasn't been tested on Windows but it should work. If it doesn't create an [issue](https://github.com/JoelMon/scriptx/issues) and I will look into it.

Use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to install ScriptX.

```bash
$ cargo install scriptx
```
